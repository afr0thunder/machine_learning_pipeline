## Product Goal and ML Framing

What is the product goal?
- Can this be done using hueristics?
- Is this solvable by another simpler method?

How to frame the product goal in terms of ML?
- Product goal is a servic or result or product.
- ML is learning a function from data.

Is a ML solution feasable?
- What kind of data is needed?
- What exisitng models leverage this kind of data?

### Models
Classification and Regression
Knowledge Extraction
Catalog Organization
Generative Models

### Data
What data is available?
- Labeled data exists
- Weakly Labeled data exists
- Unlabeled data exisits
- Need to aquire data

### Being the Algorithm
Take some time to 'be the algorithm' and work through individual examples on your own. Develop a set of features and hueristics to better understand what an algorithm might need to do.

Summarize:
* Dataset
* Model
* Latency
* Ease of Implemenation
